# FASTTypeScript  

FASTTypeScript is a recently created project that integrates with Moose and leverages the Tree-Sitter parser to analyze TypeScript source code in Pharo.  

## Features  
FASTTypeScript relies on:  
- **[FAST][fast]**, to ensure compatibility with Moose.  
- **[Pharo-Tree-Sitter][pharo-tree-sitter]**, implemented in Pharo via the FFI protocol to efficiently parse TypeScript source code. It is also used to do incremental parsing.

FASTTypeScript metamodel is defined in a way where nodes align with those generated by Tree-Sitter.

## Installation  

To load FASTTypeScript in Pharo, execute the following in a Moose image:  

```smalltalk  
Metacello new  
  baseline: 'FASTTypescript';  
  repository: 'github://moosetechnology/FASTTypescript:main';  
  load.
```
